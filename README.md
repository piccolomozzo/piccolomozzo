- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @piccolomozzo, a motorsport performance engineer with extensive experience in vehicle dynamics, optimal control, and simulation systems. I've worked with prestigious companies such as Ferrari Formula One, where I played a key role in developing the "remote garage," and Cadillac Racing, where I contributed to securing a podium finish at Le Mans 24h 2023. I am currently lead projects at Lince Group, focusing on hypercar and racing vehicle design, innovative suspension systems, and composite materials, while expanding into energy and sustainability projects like HVAC systems.
  Additionally, I am passionate about AI motorsport performance simulation, applying advanced models and optimization tools (such as IPOPT, Modelica, and Simscape), and I am engaged in freelance opportunities as an AI Tutor and Automotive Engineering Expert. My experience includes working closely with F2 and F3 teams, specifying parameters for motors, motor controllers, and batteries in vehicle applications, and exploring thermal storage solutions for renewable energy.

üëÄ My interests span across various fields, particularly focusing on motorsport performance simulation, vehicle dynamics, and energy sustainability projects.

Specifically, you are passionate about:

-  Motorsport and Hypercars: I have a deep involvement in designing and analyzing suspension systems, control implementation, and vehicle prototypes for racing vehicles
    and hypercars at Lince Group. My interests also extend to aero optimization and simulation tools like Canopy and Matlab for achieving high performance on the track.
-  AI and Optimal Control: I work with AI motorsport performance simulation and control systems, applying advanced models in fields like vehicle dynamics and energy
    optimization. I have  proficiency in tools like IPOPT, Modelica, and Python supports your work in optimal control.
-  Energy and Sustainability: I am also expanding into HVAC systems and energy storage, with a specific interest in integrating thermal storage solutions with photovoltaic systems.
    I am keen on improving energy efficiency and exploring advanced numerical models for these systems.
- Freelance Roles: I have a growing interest in freelance opportunities, particularly as an AI Tutor and Automotive Engineering Expert, sharing your expertise with smaller teams
    and projects.
  
These interests reflect my technical proficiency and innovative approach to combining motorsport knowledge with broader sustainability initiatives.

üå± Currently, I am exploring several areas to enhance your expertise and expand your technical capabilities:

  - Advanced Numerical Models in HVAC: I am diving deeper into the implementation of advanced models and simulation for HVAC systems, specifically targeting energy efficiency and control systems. You're interested in pushing beyond the standard PI and PID controllers, introducing fallback modes and more sophisticated control strategies.
  - Thermal Energy Storage Systems: I am also learning more about thermal storage solutions, focusing on their integration with photovoltaic systems. This includes understanding the latest technologies in thermal energy storage, such as phase-change materials and seasonal thermal storage.
  - Freelancing as AI Tutor: I am preparing for freelance work as an AI Tutor and Automotive Engineering Expert, seeking to refine your mentoring and educational skills in these areas, particularly in relation to vehicle dynamics and AI applications.
  

üíûÔ∏èI am looking to collaborate on several innovative fronts:
  
 - Motorsport and Hypercar Development: I am interested in partnering with teams or companies working on cutting-edge vehicle dynamics, suspension systems, and hypercar design. My focus is on projects that require expertise in aero optimization, simulation tools, and optimal control implementation.
 - AI Motorsports Simulation and Control: I want to collaborate with entities that need advanced AI performance simulation and control system optimization. This includes supporting low-budget racing teams (F2, F3) by helping them with lap time simulation and providing insights using tools like Canopy and Matlab.
 - Energy and Sustainability Projects: I am seeking partnerships in the HVAC and energy storage sectors, particularly with companies developing thermal storage systems and photovoltaic energy solutions. I am open to exploring advanced numerical modeling in these systems and enhancing control strategies beyond traditional methods.
 - Freelance AI and Automotive Engineering Roles: I am open to collaborating with smaller teams and projects as an AI tutor or consultant, bringing my deep expertise in vehicle dynamics, motorsport performance, and energy systems into educational and mentoring roles.
